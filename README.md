# updated-Assignment-4-Big-Data-Analysis
This assignment is for to apply Python pattern counting on A fastq file that contains the short DNA sequences. python scripts were written to: 1. Count the number of each base across all sequences. 2. Count the number of each pair of bases (described as kmers of size 2). 3. Count the number of each pair of bases, without assuming in advance the possible pairs (i.e. start with an empty dictionary). 4. counting kmers of any size.
